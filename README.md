# Console-Based-Ticket-Booking-System (JAVA)

A simple **Java-based console application** that demonstrates a basic online ticket booking system.

- Book Ticket (reserve an available seat)  
- Cancel Ticket (free up your seat)  
- Persistent Storage (users & tickets saved to files: `users.txt`, `tickets.txt`)    

## Tech Stack & Concepts

- **Core Concepts:**  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)  
  - Java Collections (`ArrayList`)  
  - Console Input (`Scanner`)  
  - Control Flow (`if`, `switch`, loops`)
